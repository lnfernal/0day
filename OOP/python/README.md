# Object Oriented Programming in Python
realpython.com/python3-object-oriented-programming/<br><br>

OOP provides a means of structuring programs so that properties and behaviors are bundled into individual objects. Objects could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing and running. OOP is an approach for modeling concrete, real-world things, like cars, as well as relations between things, like companies and employees, students and teachers, and so on. OOP models real-world entities as software objects that have some data associated with them and can perform certain functions. 

## Classes vs Instances
Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called <b>methods</b>, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data. Remember, a class is a blueprint for how something should be defined. It doesn't actually contain any data. The Dog class specifies that a name and age are necessary for defining a dog, but it doesn't contain the name or age of any specific dog.<br><br>

While the class is the blueprint, an instance is an object that is built from a class and contains real data.
