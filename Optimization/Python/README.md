# Code Optimization

There is a traditional sequence for writing code, and it goes like this;
1. Make it run
2. Make it right (testing)
3. Make it fast (optimization)

Also, it is good to know when a program is "fast enough" for your needs. Optimization has a price:
1. Cost in programmer time
2. Optimizaed code is often more complex
3. Optimized code is often less generic
